🌤️ Weather App

A simple and responsive Weather Application that allows users to check the current weather of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app provides real-time weather updates including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and relevant weather icons.

🔍 Features
🔎 Search for any city’s weather
🌡️ Real-time temperature updates in Celsius
💧 Humidity and wind speed display
🎯 Weather-based icons (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
❌ Error handling for invalid city names

🗝️ API Key Setup
The app uses a hardcoded API key:
const apiKey = "d8ddca19ebfdb74fff0614ba7e2ab486";
You can replace it with your own key from OpenWeatherMap.
